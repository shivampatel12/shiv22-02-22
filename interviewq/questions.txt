1. What are the different data types present in javascript?
ans = there are two types of javascript datatypes 
1.Primitive and 
2.Non Primitive

Primitive datatypes ;- these are the datatypes whose value cannot be once it get created
primitive datatypes are ;-string ,number ,boolean,undefined ,null,biginit,

Non primitive datatypes ;- these are the mutable datatypes whose value cannot be once it get created
non-primitive datatypes are ;- array, object 

2. if type of array is object  then how to detect an array in javascript ?
ans = we can detect array by using Array.isarray([]) method and by [] instanceof Array .

3. write a program two compare two array are equal or not 
ans =  let arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
let arr2 = [2,3,4,5,1]

let arr = (arr1.length ===arr2.length) && 
arr2.every((item)=>{
    if (arr2.indexOf(item)>-1){
        return(item = arr2[arr2.indexOf(item)])
    }
})

4.Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.
ans = Type coersion in javascript is automatic conversion of value from one datatype to another datatype.
it takes place when  the operands of expression are of different datatypes.
example :- String coercion takes place while using the ‘ + ‘ operator. When a number is added to a string, 
     the number type is always converted to the string type.

5.Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?
ans => javascript  is a dynamically types language in a dynamically typed langusge the type of variable are 
checked during runtime and in contrast to statically type language the type of variable are checkes during run time.

6.What is NaN property in JavaScript?
ans=> NaN propertise represents a "not a number" value . it indicates a value which is not a legal number.
